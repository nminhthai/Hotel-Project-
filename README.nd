🏨 Hotel Clustering & Data Analysis System

This project centers on extracting and analyzing hotel data from Booking.com, then applying clustering techniques to group hotels based on essential attributes such as ratings, pricing, and review volume. The objective is to generate practical insights that support hotel marketing strategies, enhance customer decision-making, and improve business planning.

🔍 Features

🧹 Data Crawling & Preprocessing: Utilizes Python and Playwright to collect hotel details, performs data cleaning and normalization, resolves missing or duplicated entries, and creates meaningful engineered features for analysis.

📊 Clustering Analysis: Implements K-Means to categorize hotels into clear segments (e.g., high-quality/popular vs. budget-oriented), offering deeper analytical perspectives for strategic evaluation.

🤖 Database Management: Saves processed data in Azure SQL and establishes role-based access control (Admin, Data Engineer, Data Analyst) along with essential backup and security practices.

📈 Data Visualization: Develops interactive analytical dashboards using Python (Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to showcase hotel distributions, price patterns, rating trends, and feature correlations.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit)

Machine Learning (K-Means, StandardScaler)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Web Scraping (Playwright)

🌟 Project Impact

The system supports users to choose accommodations based on data-driven insights, and illustrates a full data pipeline—from web scraping and preprocessing to database management, visualization, and clustering analysis.
